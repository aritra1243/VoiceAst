## Installation

### 1. Clone Project
```bash
cd e:\VoiceAst
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Setup AI Models
1. **Install Ollama** from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
2. **Pull the Qwen2 Model** (Fast & Efficient):
   ```bash
   ollama pull qwen2:0.5b
   ```
   *(Note: Config is set to use `qwen2` base name)*
3. **(Optional) Pull Vision Model**:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llava
   ```

### 4. Setup Vosk (Offline Speech)
Run the setup script to download the offline voice model:
```bash
python setup.py
```
*Or manually extract `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` to `models/`*

### 5. Configure Environment
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```
Default `.env` is already optimized for **Qwen2**.

## Usage

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```
Server runs at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Open Frontend
Open your browser to **http://localhost:8000**

## Troubleshooting

### 🌦️ Weather Not Showing?
- The app needs **Location Permission** to get accurate weather.
- If offline, it shows "Offline Mode". This is normal.
- Check if `wttr.in` is accessible from your network.

### 🐢 Slow AI?
- Ensure you have the `qwen2` model pulled.
- GPU acceleration in Ollama helps significantly.
- "Fast Path" commands should always be instant.
